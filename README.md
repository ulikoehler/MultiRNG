# MultiRNG

This is a quite old project of me where I tried to write a C++ GUI application using [wxwidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/) and the TR1 random number generations. One can parameterize the generators and distributions.

Besides being somewhat cool, it does not serve any actual purpose (besides learning more about wxwidgets and TR1 RNGs of course).
It works to some extent, but it was never really finished.

This project was imported when Google Code was announced to be closed down in early 2015.
